# Emotion-Based-music-player-and-a-band-to-play-with-face-
This is my python project where I am using tensor flow models and haar cascade models to create Emotion based music player

The GUI is done in Tkinter and the emotion are recognized by using the keras model.The basic haar cascade is used to detect the faces and the eyes.

After detecting the emotions then by using spotipy module in python we get the required kind of music.

Then use the webbrowser module to play the song by using the link of the song sent.

The unique point which I added is described as:

Today, people sit in front of the screen for long hours.During this there is almost no movement of face and the eyes.

So , in this project I have added a part Play Band where by few actions like closing one eye,closing both eyes, moving the face to right,left,top,etc and play music tone of drumroll,Triangles,Cymbals,etc...


For executing the project run the main.py file.
